    Large, high resolution Kodak CCD chip, with 10,838,016 x 9uM square pixels in a 36.3 x 24.2mm array.
    Low dark signal - Dark frames not necessary for most of the brighter deep sky objects.
    Anti-blooming with minimal effect on linearity and no lost active area.
    Built-in super high speed USB 2.0 interface for approx. 7 second downloads.
    High sensitivity, approx. 51% QE at peak (green light), 31% at H alpha.
    Back focal distance 17mm +/-1mm.
